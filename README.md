# TemplateSwitcher
python template engine

# Motivations
It's just a piece of code a took from one of my personal (dirty) project than I cleaned out to publish it on github in order to show the world:

* I can administrate a repo using complex automation trought git feature(dev/ops)
* I can manage a python project

Procedure:

* Put auto linter, test checker, test coverage report on githook. (I will do that for all my serious project from now)
* Defined clean architecture for my old code 
* Implement unitest for each class of the archi
* Change code to match architecture, run against the tests, commit test and class when it pass

Hopefully this repo may be usefull for you.
